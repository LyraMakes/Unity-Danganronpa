        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="true">Let's begin with a basic explanation of the class\nTrial! So, your votes will determine the results.</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="true">If you can figure out "whodunnit" then only they will\nrecieve punishment. But if you pick the wrong one...</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="true">...then I'll punish everyone *besides* the blackened,\nand the one that decieved everyone else will graduate!</text>
        <text character="CH-08" expression="idle" focus="true">And the killer really is one of us, right?</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="happy" focus="true">Of course!</text>
        <sound effect="explosion"/>
        <text character="CH-10" expression="yelling" focus="true">Okay then...everyone close your eyes, and whoever did it\nit, raise your hand!</text>
        <text character="CH-14" expression="angry" focus="true"> Don't be a goddamn idiot. Why the hell would they\nraise their hand?</text>
        <sound effect="ding"/>
        <text character="CH-14" expression="idle" focus="true">Before we move on and start the trial, can I ask a\nquestion real quick?</text>
        <!-- Cut to the Sayaka and Mukuro Death Portraits -->
        <text character="CH-14" expression="idle" focus="false">What's going on with...those pictures?</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="false">I'd feel awful if they got left out just because they\ndied. Friendship penetrates even death's barrier!</text>
        <sound effect="drop"/>
        <text character="CH-07" expression="shocked" focus="true">Friendship...penetrates?</text>
        <sound effect="ding"/>
        <text character="CH-04" expression="idle2" focus="true">Okay, but what about that other empty seat?</text>
        <!-- Text is *sightly* delayed -->
        <text character="CH-04" expression="idle2" focus="false">There were only fifteen of us to begin with, so why\nare there sixteen seats?</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="true">Oh, no reason. It's just that our little courtroom\nhere can technically fit up to sixteen people.</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="happy" focus="true">Okay, that about does it for the preamble. Get ready\nto get started!</text>
        <text character="CH-18" expression="idle" focus="true">First up is the case summary. Now, let the class trial...begin!</text>
        <text character="CH-08" expression="idle" focus="true">It's about to begin-the debase to decide who we think\nthe killer is...</text>
        <text character="CH-08" expression="idle" focus="true">Anything I found, anything I noticed... I have to be\nready to speak up about everything.</text>
        <text character="CH-08" expression="idle" focus="true">Because this isn't just about me. Everyone's lives are\non the line!</text>
        <!-- Narrator line still has Makoto's portrait -->
        <text character="CH-20" expression="idle" focus="false">Your first Nonstop Debate is about to begin. Would you like to hear more?</text>

        <text character="CH-08" expression="idle" focus="true">Between Sayaka and the killer, of course.</text>
        <text character="CH-02" expression="idle" focus="true">So you're saying...Sayaka wasn't caught by surprise in\nthe bathroom?</text>
        <text character="CH-04" expression="think" focus="true">She must have been attacked in the main room first,\nthen she ran to the bathroom to try and hide.</text>

        <text character="CH-14" expression="worried" focus="true">Huh? A kitchen knife...?</text>
        <text character="CH-08" expression="thinktalk" focus="true">After the murder, we discovered that one if the knives\nfrom the kitchen was missing.</text>
        <text character="CH-12" expression="think" focus="true">Which means that knife must be the murder weapon.</text>
        <text character="CH-14" expression="embarassed" focus="true">Ohh...yeah, I guess that makes sense. You could sorta\nsee the weapon stickin' out of her stomach...</text>
        <!-- Image popup of knife in Sayaka's body -->
